Top tips for landlords and international students in London’s rental market

At the start of summer, international students in their thousands begin searching for a property to rent in London. Many have never lived away from home before and navigating the process of finding somewhere isn’t always easy.
Meanwhile, landlords who’ve previously let to corporate or family tenants might see themselves letting their property to a student for the very first time.
As the student search period kicks in, here are my top tips for landlords and tenants entering the student rental market:
Tips for landlords:
Student lets could mean longer tenancies:
 Some landlords may have let to students before, others could be making their foray into the student market for the first time. In doing so, as well as opening up the property to a much wider pool of tenants, it may result in a three-year tenancy too as some students want to secure a place to call home for the entirety of their degree. Landlords of new builds will find that they are especially popular, both from a maintenance and security perspective as parents will often stipulate a porter or concierge as being a non-negotiable.
Think about including a cleaner in the rent:
 Enrolling at university may be the first time in a student’s life that they have lived independently. Over the years, we have seen a number of landlords opt to include a weekly or bi-weekly cleaning service within the rent which can often be a great help as the tenant settles into their new living and studying arrangements in the UK.
Make sure it’s furnished:
 Almost all international tenants will want a furnished property so it’s important that a landlord kits it out in advance. I’d always advise going for quality furniture as not only will it stand the test of time but it is also likely to make the property more appealing. Tenants will often be keen to make a house a home with artwork or plants and will provide their own bedding and kitchen utensils/equipment so a landlord won’t need to include this as part of the tenancy.
Tips for tenants:
Register early and keep in regular touch:
 Given the volume of students coming to study here, registering and staying in contact with a lettings agent is essential in order to stay ahead of the competition. That way you’ll receive updates on new instructions as they hit the market, and by popping in or speaking with your agent regularly, they will know you are still keen to secure a property. Many students will begin their search from as early as June onwards – even if they aren’t planning to move to London until the autumn – as they’ll want to get used to their new surroundings before returning for the start of term. Timing is vitally important – so make sure it’s on your side.
Have someone in the UK who is available to view:
 The introduction of virtual viewings during Covid continues to act as an essential house-hunting tool but we do require someone to conduct an in-person viewing on a tenant’s behalf before a landlord is presented with an offer. This physical inspection is key because it provides an in-depth view of every aspect of a property in a way that virtual tools simply can’t.
A property should be taken as seen:
 It’s important to remember to take a property as you see it and that if you want something to be updated, speak to the agent. Unlike in other global cities, London landlords don’t usually refresh a property between tenancies as a matter of course. So if you want anything changed – make sure you ask.  
Family matters:
 A tenant may be the first of their family to come and study in the UK but not the last; we regularly see siblings follow their elder brother or sister to London one or two years later. While a one bedroom apartment may be the immediate requirement, taking a slightly longer-term view to account for any siblings moving in the future as well as parents or relatives who’ll be coming to stay might mean that renting somewhere with two bedrooms will save the need to move again at a later date. 
Utilise your agent’s local area knowledge:
 Moving to a new city can be daunting so tenants will tend to look for somewhere close to their place of study. We often have students looking to live four or five streets away from their university which significantly reduces the number of properties that might be available to them. I’d always advise a tenant to ask their agent about travel times, routes and alternative areas with a lifestyle they might like; London’s transport system and walkability means that sometimes a property slightly further away can work extremely well.

You don’t need us to tell you that 
London
’s private rental market is well and truly fucked. It’s hard to make sense of it at the best of times, but it can be especially tricky if you’re a student. Q
ueuing up for viewings of mould-infested houses isn’t what you need when you’re trying to get ahead on your studies, or, more importantly, enjoying the last dregs of summer with your mates.
According to a survey of more than 20,000 students by Knight Frank and UCAS, less than 70 percent of students applying for university for the first time this year thought that there were enough accommodation options in their chosen city. And if you’re a student or soon-to-be student looking for private rentals in London, you’re going to be up against the thick of it: bidding wars, dodgy landlords, snakey drop-out flatmates. I’ve been through it, my mates have been through it, and you’ll be going through it soon, too. The process itself is stressful AF, but once you settle into your new London life and are living like the main character every day, I promise it will be worth it.
So if you’re wondering how the hell you’re going to manage, look no further: we’ve asked housing experts as well as past and present students for their very best tips on securing a private rental. And don’t worry: you’ve got this. 
1. Start your search early 
But not 
too
 early. We recommend starting your housing search about two months prior to your move-in date: that way you can get an idea of how the market is looking and avoid as much stress as possible. ‘In the worst case scenario, you can be left with nowhere to live,’ says India-Rose, a recent graduate from City, University of London. ‘I had friends living in Airbnbs or hostels just so they could go to their courses.’ 
2. Think carefully about who you want to live with
This can be a touchy one. You might really want to move in with your new boyfriend/girlfriend who you met at the end of first year, but let’s be real: that might not be the smartest idea. ‘Make sure you have an idea early on about who you’re going to move in with,’ says Lucas Dastros-Pitei, University College London’s student union accommodation and housing officer. ‘I would say avoid living alone. The more flatmates you have, the cheaper your housing costs are usually going to be.’ If you’re struggling to find a buddy-up, try posting a call-out on social media, joining Facebook groups like ‘gals who rent’, ‘Hackney Wick Spaces’, or ‘MatesPlace’, or using your university’s matching service if they have one. 
3. Don’t overlook the help available to you
It’s expensive to be a student. But your uni is (usually) there to help you. ‘There is a lot of support available for low income students, for those who have care responsibilities or those from estranged families,’ says Lucas. Both universities and their independent student unions usually have a whole list of bursaries available with different criteria. And if you’re facing genuine difficulties paying for rent, food and other necessities, don’t hesitate about contacting the uni. Many (if not most) will have a pot of money dedicated to helping students out, which can be a literal godsend.
4. Watch out for scammers
If a property seems too good to true, we’re afraid it probably is. ‘Scammers target students online when they’re looking for accommodation,’ says Lucas. ‘The biggest red flag is asking for a holding deposit before viewing a property. If you’re a first time renter, you might not know that.’ But most unis will have an advice service: use it. ‘
They can help you look over adverts and contracts and check for scammers,’ says Lucas. If the property ad is poorly written, the photos seem doubtful given the price, or the ‘agency’ ring you to say ‘sorry this one is gone, but we have another similar property around the corner’, get out of there pronto.
5. Use your uni housing service
If you’re part of the University of London, we’d recommend you start your search using the UoL property portal. All of the landlords and properties on there are approved by the uni and it’s only available to accredited students, so you’ll
 know what you’re getting is legit. Many London unis will have similar platforms. 
6. Be a good communicator – and a fast replier
Decent digs are frequently snapped up on the day they’re listed: you have to be quick or they’ll slip through your fingers. Setting up alerts on your phone and calling people back straight away always helps. ‘Just be a really good communicator with whoever you’re dealing with: the landlord or the agent,’ says Tiger Wang, from estate agents Knight Frank. ‘Be polite and speedy with replies, because it really matters. If you take two or three days to get back to someone, you’re not going to get a property – they can go within a day. Being someone who talks and gets on the phone always helps. And be honest about what you want and can afford.’
7. Make sure you have all the paperwork (and deposit) ready to go 
As you know, competition for private rentals can be fierce. 
‘If you don’t pay the holding deposit or response within one day, the property will probably go,’ says Wang. ‘Have it ready along with your proof of address. It’s also really important to get a good reference.’ 
 If you’re coming from overseas, you’ll also need to make sure your visa is sorted and you have the cash ready to pay rent upfront if necessary.
8. Get yourself a guarantor
M
ost overseas students will need to pay a hefty six months of rent (at least) upfront to secure a property – unless they have a UK guarantor, in which case they can usually pay monthly. (A guarantor is someone who agrees they will pay your rent on your behalf if you fall into financial difficulty, like a family member or family friend.) 
‘Guarantors need to prove that they earn five times the annual rent, which can be a lot for anyone,’ says Wang. ‘If this is a struggle, we’d recommend to not be too picky about where they’re living or get university-managed accommodation instead.’ Reach out to your university if you’re really struggling: they might be able to help you find a property which doesn’t require one or provide other support. 
Some councils and charities also have guarantee schemes that can act as a guarantor service or help you out with cash for advance rent payments. 
9. Check, check, check again
You’ve put in the work, secured your new digs and you’re probably buzzing. But stop right there. You’re going to want to future-proof your tenancy. By this we mean: ph
otograph every last defect and every last chip, log the electricity/water/gas meter readings and get the inventory done and dusted. Your future self will thank you for it.

Tips and trick to find your student accommodation in London
			Tips and trick to find your student accommodation in London		
Renting in London means discovering new rules and practices that might be different from your country. London is a very pleasant and dynamic capital, but it still is one of the most expensive. Apartments, houses, maisonettes, lofts, the rental offer is vast, but how do you make sure your monthly budget doesn’t end up in rent?
Here are some tips and tricks to find your student accommodation in London, and don’t get broke!
1 – The cheapest areas in London
London rents make it difficult for many people to live in a decent place, especially if you attend a central University and don’t want to spend hours commuting.
Actually there are a 
few central but cheap neighborhoods in London
. The area are cheap for one reason: transport may not be frequent or there’s only the national rail network, or it does not have schools or hospitals. This is a 
good criterion to make a first selection
 of the most desirable neighborhoods.
Further, many people want to live in the Northern or West part of the city, so the Southern and
 the East part of London
 sometimes can give good rental opportunities.
2 – Flat sharing
If sharing an apartment or a house with several people is a solution that suits you, go for it! Just bear in mind 
some disadvantages
: lack of privacy, tranquility, impromptu departure of one of the roommates, a divided rent, ditto for the bills…
But this option can help with the loneliness you may feel when settling in this country that is completely new to you. Still, if you want to have some privacy and not get broke, choose to live in a
student residence
.
3 – Be forward thinking!
We strongly advise you to anticipate your arrival: book your room in a flat, your studio, or your apartment in London before your departure. First, you’ll have less stress once you get there. Then, this will save you from paying for nights in Airbnb, or in hotels, and time to find your accommodation.
Also, ask info about what’s included in the rent: bills, bedding, internet connection…
Renting without seeing the place you’re going to live in is not recommended. You’d better plan a long weekend to visit the rooms or the flats you’ve seen online, or you can rely on the
 reliable companies that help students and professionals like you
 to find the dream place in London!

A Student’s Guide to Finding Accommodation in London
Most students agree that studying in London is a fantastic experience. Some of the world’s highest-regarded academic establishments are here, such as Kings College, UCL, LSE and Westminster, to name just a few.
London Student accommodation – Before you start searching
Most students agree that studying in London is a fantastic experience. Some of the world’s highest-regarded academic establishments are here, such as 
Kings College
, 
UCL
, 
LSE
 and 
Westminster
, to name just a few.
Your accommodation is a major part of this experience. Find the right place, that works within your budget, and it will directly benefit your studies (and your social life).
With that in mind, here’s a comprehensive guide to selecting the right student accommodation in London – and ensuring you get the most from your time in the capital.
London Student accommodation – Before you start searching
Before you start scouring the market for suitable accommodation, there are some important things to consider:
– What’s your budget?
Make sure you identify how much you can realistically afford to pay each month, and make sure you factor in all the costs involved.
– Which area?
Some areas are ultra-desirable, but be warned, they’re likely to come with an accompanying price-tag. If you’re thinking of living in a student house, a better option might be exploring other streets nearby, which may offer you more space for your money.
– Who will you be living with?
Chances are that you’ll be sharing your accommodation with other people. It’s a wise idea to choose your housemates carefully – and you may want to assemble a group before you start searching for a place to call home. Be as honest with yourself as possible. For example, some friends are great to spend an evening down the pub with, but may not be ideal as a long-term housemate.
– Who will take responsibility for what?
Living in student accommodation comes with some responsibilities. Before you move in, work out how the bills will be paid, as this will avoid arguments with housemates further down the line.
Ask the important questions…
You should ask the following:
– How many bedrooms do you need?
– How close is your university or college?
– Are there transport links close by?
– Do you need a private bathroom?
– What kitchen facilities do you need?
– What things are on your ‘desirable to have’ list? (e.g. outdoor space, a gym, underground parking etc.)
What sort of student accommodation?
Halls of residence
Halls of residence are usually reserved for first year students, and are a great way to ease into the experience of living independently. They’re often situated on or near the university campus, and provide the perfect opportunity to socialise with fellow students.
Typically, you’ll rent a room in a hall of residence. Some are compact, while others offer a double bed, an en suite, and sometimes shared leisure facilities too. Be aware, these rooms are more expensive than other types of accommodation.
Reserving a room
It’s advisable to visit the halls before you commit, to see if the accommodation is suitable for you. Most universities work with private sector organisations (like 
UNITE
), who manage the halls of residence on their behalf. Don’t presume that there are automatically enough rooms for every student – you have to reserve your room well in advance of your course starting.
Booking is done on a first-come, first-serve basis, and a deposit of £200 to £500 is sometimes required to secure your place.
Average costs
Costs vary considerably, depending on which educational establishment you’re attending. Your maintenance loan should cover minimum living expenses. Expect to pay around £60 to £120 a week for a room in a hall of residence, though this can sometimes be more.
Your rent is likely to cover all bills, plus wi-fi and security. Some places may even offer parking permits and contents insurance, though this may incur an additional fee.
House share
House shares are perfect for students progressing to their second year. By now, you’ll have found a group of friends that you can comfortably live with, and you’ll feel more confident with taking on more responsibility in terms of your accommodation.
Most student houses are situated in areas that are already dominated with university houses. This is sometimes referred to as ‘studentification’.
Rooms in student accommodation
Unless you can afford to rent an entire property on your own, you’ll probably rent your own room, and enjoy shared access to the communal living areas, plus the kitchen and bathroom. Rooms vary enormously, depending on the type of house you decide to live in. Bear in mind, some may be unfurnished; though it’s more common for them to include some furniture.
To secure your student home, you’ll sign a Tenancy Agreement. This commits you to paying the agreed sum of rent each week or month. Usually, all students living in the same house will sign one Tenancy Agreement, which means, if there any issues at the end of the tenancy, you’ll need to divide up the remainder of the deposit amongst yourselves.
Disputes are uncommon in student houses, but they do happen. That’s why it’s a good idea to take photos of the property when you move in, and complete a comprehensive inventory too.
Securing your student home
Sometimes, you can find shared housing via your university’s online student portal. Alternatively, you can ask the Accommodation Office, as they’re likely to have a list of available properties. Local letting agents and student accommodation websites are good options too.
Bear in mind, if you and your friends don’t fill the property (for example, if there are only three or you, and there are five bedrooms), your landlord may choose to rent to additional students, to ensure the vacant space is filled. To secure the home, you’ll have to pay a deposit up front, which is usually a month’s rent.
Average costs
You can expect to pay less for a house share than a room in a hall of residence. However, utilities bills might not be included in your rent, so you’ll have to factor those into your monthly budget. Consider travel expenses too, as most student houses are situated a bit further away from the college or university campus.
The amount of rent you’ll pay is dependent on the area you choose to live in. On average, anticipate paying around £550 per month. The good news is that, as a full-time student, you’ll be exempt from paying council tax. To make sure you don’t get charged, obtain the relevant forms from the Accommodation Office, fill them out, then send them to your local authority.
Private housing
When it comes to private housing, there are a few options available. These include: renting a room in a private hall of residence, renting in a private house, or having your own private accommodation.
Private halls of residence
These are halls that are managed by private companies. These often offer the same benefits as a university hall of residence, but there are a few key differences. For example, contracts usually last 52 weeks, and you may find yourself living alongside students from other academic establishments. Expect to pay around £140 a week for a room in a place like this.
Room in a private house
This is sometimes a cheaper option, but the downside is that you’ll be living with your landlord, not your friends! However, there are some benefits. For example, some landlords may include meals for an additional cost.
Private flat
This is an expensive choice of accommodation, but the perk of having privacy may make it worth the extra cost. You’ll not only have a bedroom to call your own, but also a kitchen, living area, bathroom and perhaps outdoor space too.
Signing up for student accommodation – the questions to ask
Here’s a checklist of what to ask before you commit:
– What are the broadband speeds?
– How much are the bills (if they’re not included)?
– What is the minimum term of the contract?
– What furniture, fixtures and fittings are included?
– How much deposit will you pay?
– When can you move in?
– How much are the agency fees (if applicable)?
– Is the agency part of a recognised body? For example, RIB are members of 
ARLA
, 
Safe Agent
 and 
PropertyMark
.
Your budgeting checklist
You’ll need to work out your monthly outgoings, to ensure you can afford to pay the rent. Factor in the following costs:
– Food (either catered in halls of residence, or purchased then cooked at home)
– Gas and electricity
– Internet and phone connection
– Mobile phone contract
– Laundry services (if applicable)
– Travel expenses
– Contents insurance
– Social activities
– Books and equipment for college or university
Remember, you may be entitled to a maintenance loan or grant. Don’t include an interest-free student overdraft into your budgeting, as you’ll have to start paying this back after you graduate. If you need assistance with budgeting, check out 
savethestudent.org
, which has online tools to help you.
Keeping an eye on money
It’s worthwhile setting aside half an hour each week to review your spending, and check that you’re not paying out more than you can afford. If possible, place some funds into a savings account – this always comes in handy in the event of emergencies.
There are plenty of financial perks available to students, so do make the most of them. Your TOTUM student card offers plenty of discounts – to apply for one, visit 
https://www.totum.com/
.
Attending viewings
Once you’ve got a shortlist of accommodation options, it makes sense to view them in person. One in ten student groups sign a contract for the first house they view, but that doesn’t mean you have to – you may want to see a few, so you can compare what’s on offer.
Try not to be dazzled by fancy appliances or mod-cons. You don’t want to rent a student home, only to find that there are major issues with the property that’ll cause you headaches further down the line.
When viewing student accommodation, pay attention to the following:
– Location. Check out what’s in the vicinity. For example, a bus stop or a local convenience store are likely to both be useful to you in the future. If it’s a walkable distance to your university, find out how long it’ll
take to get there. If it’s not, make sure you check how much it’ll cost in train or bus fares to get to your lectures.
– Surrounding houses. Does it look like a good neighbourhood? Are the surrounding properties in relatively good order? It’s never a good idea to rely on gut instinct alone, but neither should you ignore it. If a
place doesn’t feel quite right, that usually means there’s something wrong with it.
– Security. You’ll be leaving valuables in this property, so you want to be assured that it’s safe to do so. Check the access points, and make sure there are locks on the doors and windows. Ideally, the road will be
well lit at night too.
– Safety. Your safety is a top priority. Make sure fire alarms have been installed, and that fire extinguishers and fire blankets are functional and accessible.
– Pests. Pests are a real problem, especially if there’s a significant infestation in the house. Look for evidence of mice, rats, slugs, banana flies and pigeons – all of these can cause serious problems.
– Water pressure and leaking. Ask to see the showers and taps in action, to check the water pressure is adequate. Look around the bases of sink units too, just in case there are any problems with leaking.
– Energy efficiency. If the property is old, it might not be that energy efficient. This is bad for the environment, and means you’ll pay more for your heating too. Ask about the energy efficiency, and find out if the
property is well insulated too.
– Damp. Damp houses are not only unpleasant to live in, they can be bad for your health as well, especially if mould is present. Check for mould around windows and in the bathroom, and press your hand to the
walls. Usually, you can tell if a wall is damp, as it feels slightly clammy and cold to touch.
– Furniture. It’s worth noting that any house advertised as student accommodation needs to supply a desk and chair in each bedroom. Make sure you find out what else is included in the tenancy agreement.
Working with letting agents
Landlords often hire letting agents to handle their properties on their behalf. These letting agents can be useful for tenants as well as landlords. For example, if you let them know you’re looking for accommodation, they’ll be happy to forward you details of appropriate properties – often before they’ve even come to market.
A good letting agent will never pressurise you into signing a contract. They won’t hassle you all the time by sending you property details – so if you’d actively like them to do this, make your interest known. Remember, it’s their job to answer your questions, so don’t be afraid to ask.
Your contract
A tenancy agreement outlines the responsibilities your landlord has in relation to the tenant. It details your responsibilities too. Always read your contract carefully, and if you’re not sure about anything, ask your letting agent, or the Accommodation Office / Student’s Union.
Types of contract
There are several types of contract, but the ones you’re most likely to encounter are:
– Fixed term. That means you can live in the property for a specified period, and that you agree to pay rent for the entire duration of your time there.
– Joint tenancy. This means that you and your housemates share liability for damages, bills, and rent arrears.
Your responsibilities
It’s your responsibility to:
– Pay the rent on time
– Pay the bills on time
– Maintain the property to an acceptable standard
– Tell your landlord if any problems arise
– Comply with all other terms of the contract
Your landlord’s responsibilities
Your landlord must:
– Let you live in peace – if they need to enter the premises, they must give you 24 hours’ notice in writing
– Maintain the structure and exterior of the property
– Ensure the house is safe and habitable
– Keep all appliances, heating and electrics in good working order
Guarantors
Having a guarantor is an increasingly popular option. Your guarantor is usually a parent or guardian, and they will offer to ‘guarantee’ that you can pay the rent, and agree to cover the costs if you fail to do so. The advantage of having a guarantor is that it makes you a more appealing tenant to prospective landlords. You may be able to secure a better quality of student house too.
What do you need in order to secure your student accommodation?
If you’re ready to sign the contract, you’ll need to supply the following:
– ID (usually in the form of a passport)
– Visa (if applicable)
– A letter from your university, confirming your place there
– The necessary funds to secure the property

				The 10 Best Universities in London for International Students			
Student accommodation in the 21st century is moving away from grubby house shares to bespoke ensuites and private kitchens. Now you’ve secured your place at university, let stuhomes guide you through securing your student accommodation.
Your rent will depend on a variety of different things including location, amenities included and room type. Once you have a budget in mind you can search for rooms and find the one that suits you perfectly.
At stuhomes we have various properties in the best parts of London that’ll suit every budget, whether you’re after an ensuite or studio. Best of all our prices are inclusive of all bills and include a range of amenities including social spaces and high speed Wi-Fi – a few less things to worry about.
Familiarise yourself with not just the area around your campus, but other areas in London too. With excellent transport links, London is your oyster! You’re not restricted to living close to your university, you can live in any area which suits your lifestyle.
Perhaps you’d prefer a quieter space like our Kirby Street Residence so you can focus on your studies, or you want to live within the hustle and bustle of London like our East Central House in Shoreditch, immersing yourself in the best bars and nightlife the capital has to offer. Whatever your vibe, make sure you research the area to find the best fit for your social and educational needs.
Student accommodations will vary in the amenities they offer so identify what is most important to you and see who can fulfil your needs.
Each of our properties come with a variety of amenities from laundry facilities on site to social areas and open spaces (a rarity for student accommodation in London!), as well as all bills included and Wi-Fi. At stuhomes there’s something for everyone so take a look and discover the exceptional features each of our properties have to offer.
We understand you want to live as close to your university as possible. Use google maps to determine your commute time via public transport, walking or even by taxi. If you’re considering accommodation further from your chosen university to save money or because you prefer a different area, weigh up the benefits against the drawbacks of a longer commute.
Our property pages show our exact location so take a look and see if they suit your commute.
Student accommodation may not always be cheap and you need to understand the contract you’re entering. Handshake deals or finding someone on Facebook marketplace might seem like a good idea at the time but you’ll have no protection on rent, deposit repayments or help with other concerns.
Your deposit should also be placed into a tenancy deposit scheme to protect your money. Here at stuhomes we ensure your deposit is protected and placed in a Government-backed tenancy deposit scheme for your security as well as ensuring all details regarding your accommodation are clearly laid out in your licence agreement. See our FAQs for more details.

Student accommodation tips to find housing in and around London
In collaboration with
Finding accommodation in a bustling city like London can seem daunting, but fear not. You are just the correct information away! If you have eliminated university 
student accommodation in London
 for any reason, whether the amenities or the cost, don’t worry, as private student accommodation has a lot of benefits, and you will find something that meets all your needs. Remember that where you choose to live can ultimately make or break your university experience. So this read might come in handy!
We have gathered all the tips to make this easy for you, from budgeting to viewing properties so that you can easily find your ideal home away from home!
How to find student housing in London?
Choosing the right place to live is crucial as it can significantly influence your university experience. Whether you’re looking for something close to your campus or considering private accommodation due to costs or amenities, we’ve got you covered.
Research neighborhoods
The first step in your search is to narrow down which neighbourhoods suit you best. Consider factors such as 
proximity to your campus
, your 
preferred zone
, nearby 
shops,
 and, most importantly, your budget. Depending on your program, living close to campus might be optional, which opens up a more comprehensive range of options.
Make a list of areas you’re interested in. This will help streamline your search and allow you to focus on finding the right property.
Set a budget
Setting a budget is one of the most critical steps in finding student housing in London. London is known for its high living costs, so it is essential to know how much you’re willing to spend before starting your search.
Plenty of accommodation options in London cater to various needs and budgets. Whether you’re looking for basic amenities or luxurious features, you’ll find something that fits your budget.
Consider transportation
Consider the available transportation options if your chosen accommodation isn’t close to your campus. Check the proximity of bus stops and train stations and how long it will take to get to your campus.
Be realistic about your commute. While a one-hour travel time might seem manageable when looking at properties, it can become tiresome when you have to make the journey daily for classes.
Use online platforms
Searching online is the best way to find student housing in London. Once you have your requirements, you can refine your search and browse properties in your desired location.
Be as specific as possible in your search terms. Instead of general terms like “houses” or “rooms,” use “student accommodation in London.” This specificity will help you avoid rental properties that don’t meet your needs. Always check images and reviews of properties to make informed decisions. You can opt for websites like UniAcco and Uniplaces to complete the search and find the accommodation of your dreams.
Evaluate the security
Safety should be a top priority when searching for student housing. Check the security features of the accommodation and how well-lit the area is at night.
View properties
While online images are helpful, they can’t replace an in-person visit. Viewing the property allows you to check all the features firsthand before committing.
Talk to the students
When viewing properties, take the opportunity to talk to current residents. They can provide unbiased reviews and insights about the accommodation better than any online review.
Review tenancy contracts
Reading the tenancy contract is crucial, even if it seems tedious. Be aware of all the conditions, such as guest policies and decoration restrictions. Consider having someone else read the contract to ensure you have caught everything.
Finding student housing in London can be challenging, but it’s manageable with careful research, planning, and considering critical factors like location, budget, and amenities. Use the tips to make your search easier and ensure you find a place that feels like home.
FAQs
How early should I start looking for student housing in London?
It’s best to start your search at least 3-6 months before your move-in date to ensure you have enough time to find the perfect place.
Are there any specific websites recommended for finding student housing in London?
Websites like UniAcco and Uniplaces are great for finding student accommodation in London.
What is the average cost of student accommodation in London?
The average cost can vary but typically ranges from £500 to £1,500 per month, depending on the location and amenities.
How can I ensure the neighbourhood I choose is safe?
Research crime rates in the area, visit the neighbourhood at different times and talk to current residents to get a sense of safety.
Is it better to live alone or with roommates in London?
This depends on your personal preferences and budget. Living with roommates can reduce costs and provide companionship while living alone offers more privacy and independence.

Overview of housing in the United Kingdom
Typical Victorian terraced housing in 
Hampshire
.
Housing in the United Kingdom
 represents the largest non-financial asset class in the UK; its overall net value passed the £5 trillion mark in 2014.
[
1
]
 Housing includes modern and traditional styles. About 30% of homes are owned outright by their occupants, and a further 40% are owner-occupied on a 
mortgage
.  About 18% are 
social housing
 of some kind, and the remaining 12% are privately rented.
[

The UK ranks in the top half in 
Europe
 with regard to rooms per person, amenities, and quality of housing.
[

[

 However, the cost of housing as a proportion of income is higher than average among EU countries,
[

 and the 
increasing cost of housing in the UK
 may constitute a housing crisis for some, especially in 
London

History

Pre Victorian era
[

Medieval house using a timber structure
High-end Georgian stone terrace at Royal Crescent, Bath
In the medieval era and later, houses were often built of timber
[
9
]
 and were heated by fires. Houses were typically built individually until the advent of town planning in the Georgian era, when terraces began to be built.
[
10
]
Victorian era
[
edit
]
Rapid population growth took place in the nineteenth century, particularly terraces in cities with the widespread adoption of mass-produced bricks.
[
11
]
  The new homes were arranged and funded via building societies that dealt directly with large contracting firms.
[
12
]
[
13
]
   Private renting from housing landlords was the dominant tenure. People moved in so rapidly that there was not enough capital to build adequate housing for everyone, so low-income newcomers squeezed into increasingly overcrowded slums. Clean water, sanitation, and public health facilities were inadequate; the death rate was high, especially infant mortality, and 
tuberculosis
 among young adults.
[

1900–1939
[
edit
]
The rapid expansion of housing was a major success story of the interwar years, 1919–1939, standing in sharp contrast to the United States, where the construction of new housing practically collapsed after 1929. The total housing stock in England and Wales was 7,600,000 in 1911; 8,000,000 in 1921; 9,400,000 in 1931; and 11,300,000 in 1939.
[

The Wormholt Estate is typical of 'cottage' interwar housing - brick walls, tiled roofs, low rise with front and rear gardens.

History of rent control in England and Wales § 1915 to 1939
The private rent market provided 90% of the housing before the war. Now it came under heavy pressure, regarding rent controls, and the inability of owners to evict tenants, except for non-payment of rent. The tenants had a friend in 
Liberal
Prime Minister
, 
David Lloyd George
, and especially in the increasingly powerful 
Labour Party
. The private rent sector went into a prolonged decline and never recovered; by 1938, it covered only 58% of the housing stock.
[

A decisive change in policy was marked by the 
Tudor Walters Report
 of 1918; it set the standards for council house design and location for the next ninety years.
[
19
]
[
20
]
 It recommended housing in short terraces, spaced at 70 feet (21 m) at a density of twelve to the acre.
[

]
   With the 
Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act 1919
David Lloyd George
 set up a system of government housing that followed his 1918 election campaign promises of "homes fit for heroes."  It required local authorities to survey their housing needs, and start building houses to replace slums. The treasury subsidised the low rents. The immediate impact was the prevalence of the three-bedroom house, with kitchen, bathroom, parlour, electric lighting, and gas cooking, often built as subsidised council housing. Major cities such as London and Birmingham built large-scale housing estates – one in Birmingham had a population of 30,000 residents. The houses were built in blocks of two or four using brick or stucco, with two storeys. They were set back from curving streets; each had a long garden. Shopping centres, churches and pubs sprang up nearby. Eventually, the city would provide a community hall, schools, and a public library. The residents typically were the upper fifth stratum of the 
working-class
. The largest of these two communities was 
Becontree
 in the outer suburbs of London, where construction began in 1921, and by 1932 there were 22,000 houses holding 103,000 residents.
[
22
]
 Slum clearance now moved from being a public health issue, to a matter of town planning.
[
23
]
Liberal MP 
Tudor Walters
 was inspired by the 
garden city movement
, calling for spacious low-density developments and semi-detached houses built to a high construction standard. Older women could now vote. Local politicians consulted with them and in response put more emphasis on such amenities as communal laundromats, extra bedrooms, indoor lavatories, running hot water, separate parlours to demonstrate their respectability, and practical vegetable gardens rather than manicured yards. The housewives had had their fill of chamber pots.
[
24
]
[
25
]
  Progress was not automatic, as shown by the troubles of rural 
Norfolk
. Many dreams were shattered as local authorities had to renege on promises they could not fulfill due to undue haste, impossible national deadlines, debilitating bureaucracy, lack of lumber, rising costs, and the unaffordability of rents by the rural poor.
[
26
]
In England and Wales, 214,000 multi-unit council buildings were built by 1939; making the Ministry of Health largely a ministry of housing.
[
27
]
 Council housing accounted for 10% of the housing stock in the UK by 1938, peaking at 32% in 1980, and dropping to 18% by 1996, where it held steady for the next two decades.

Debates on high-rise housing
[
edit
]
The fierce debates over high-rise housing that took place after 1945 were presaged by an acrimonious debate in the 1920s and 1930s in London. On the political left there was firm opposition to what were denounced as "barracks for the working-classes". Reformers on the right called for multi-storey solutions to overcrowding and high rents. There were attempts at compromise by developing new solutions to urban living, focused especially on slum clearance and redevelopment schemes. The compromises generally sought to replace inhospitable slums with high-rise blocks served by lifts. In the 
Metropolitan Borough of Stepney
 they included John Scurr House (built 1936–1937), Riverside Mansions (1925–1928) and the Limehouse Fields project (1925 but never built).

Increasingly the British ideal was home ownership, even among the working class. Rates of home ownership rose steadily from 15 percent of people owning their own home before 1914, to 32 percent by 1938, and 67 percent by 1996. The construction industry sold the idea of home ownership to upscale renters. The mortgage lost its old stigma of a millstone round your neck to instead be seen as a smart long-term investment in suburbanized Britain.  It appealed to aspirations of upward mobility and made possible the fastest rate of growth in working-class owner-occupation during the 20th century.

  The boom was largely financed by the savings ordinary Britons put into their building societies.  Starting in the 1920s favourable tax policies encouraged substantial investment in the societies, creating huge reserves for lending. Beginning in 1927, the societies encouraged borrowing through gradual liberalization of mortgage terms.

Political poster: ″A million new homes thanks to Labour″
Political poster: ″The way things are going I shall grow up before we get our house. Vote Conservative for more houses more quickly.″
Housing was a critical shortage in the post-war era. Air raids had destroyed half a million housing units; repairs and maintenance on undamaged homes had been postponed. 3,000,000 new dwellings were needed. The government aimed for 300,000 to be built annually, compared to the maximum pre-war rate of 350,000. However, there were shortages of builders, materials, and funding. The 
Ministry of Works
 undertook the publication of a set of 
Post War Building Studies
, that established technical guidelines for the use of new or modernised building materials. Not counting 150,000 temporary prefabricated units, the nation was still 1,500,000 units short by 1951. Legislation kept rents down, but did not affect purchased houses. The ambitions of the  
New Towns Act 1946
 (
9 & 10 Geo. 6
. c. 68) project were idealistic, but did not provide enough urgently needed units. When the 
Conservative Party
 returned to power in 1951, they made housing a high priority and oversaw 2,500,000 new units, two-thirds of them through local councils. Haste made for dubious quality, and policy increasingly shifted toward renovation rather than new builds. Slums were cleared, opening the way for gentrification in the inner cities.

According to a 2018 study in the 
Economic History Review
, the ‘
stop-go
’ macroeconomic policy framework adopted by the Treasury and the Bank of England from the mid-1950s to the early 1980s restricted house-building during the period.

Demography
[
edit
]
There are approximately 23 million dwellings in England and some 27 million across the UK. In 2009, about 30% of homes were owned outright by their occupants, and a further 40% were owner-occupied on a 
mortgage
. About 18% are 
social housing
 of some kind, and the remaining 12% are privately rented.
[
2
]
  The overall mean number of bedrooms is approximately 2.8.  Just under 40% of households have at least two spare bedrooms.
[
42
]
 20% of dwellings were built before 1919 and 15% were built post 1990.
[
42
]
 29% of all dwellings are 
terraced
, 42% are detached or semi-detached, and the remaining 29% are bungalows or flats. The mean floor area is 95 square metres.
[
42
]
 Approximately 4% of all dwellings were vacant.
[
42
]
 Approximately 385,000 households reported a fire between 2012 and 2014, the majority of which were caused by cooking.
[
43
]
 In 2014 2.6 million households moved dwelling, the majority of which (74%) were renters.

Affordability of housing in the United Kingdom
House in Hampstead Garden Suburb, 
London
After adjusting for inflation, the average cost of a home increased by a factor of 3.4 between 1950 and 2012.
[
51
]
In September 2015 the average house price was £286,000, and affordability of housing as measured by price to earnings ratio was 5.3.
[
52
]
 The UK's home dwelling cost per type in July 2018 was on average:
[
53
]
Detached: £378,473
Semi-detached: £230,284
Terraced: £200,889
Flat/maisonette: £230,603
London is ranked as the top city in the world in terms of the number of 
ultra high net worth individuals
 who are resident in a city.
[
54
]
 The consequence of this is seen in the high price for top-end dwellings. The most expensive home ever sold in the UK was 
2–8a Rutland Gate
, Hyde Park, which sold for £280 million in 2015.
[
55
]
 The most expensive street in the UK is 
Kensington Palace Gardens
, London, where the average price of a home is approximately £42 million.
[
56
]
A report for 
Wandsworth Borough Council
 found that overseas investors had a positive effect on housing affordability, both in bringing forward new homes in general and allowing the affordable housing part of schemes to be brought forward more quickly. They also found that there was very little evidence of housing being left empty.
[
57
]
 Dwellings represent the largest non-financial asset in the British balance sheet, with a net worth of £5.1 trillion (2014).

 However, the supply of rental properties has been declining since 2016 when the taxation treatment of rental property turned against landlords.
[
59
]
 Nearly all dwellings  are let using 
Assured shorthold tenancy
 agreements.
[
60
]
 For the initial period, typically six months or a year, neither side can terminate the agreement. After this period, landlords can terminate the agreement at two months' notice.
Council Tax
 is paid by the occupier of the home unless it is a 
house in multiple occupation
 (HMO) when the landlord is liable. In London, rents are double the national average, meaning that living in London has become a luxury good. People on median incomes who work in central London often live in the outer suburbs of London and the commuting towns of South East England.
[

In 2023, rental costs in England are found to be 25.4% more affordable than owning a property with a mortgage, marking the first time this has occurred since 2010. In Wales, renting is 15.8% more economical than owning a mortgaged property. However, in Scotland, owning a property with a mortgage is 5.5%

Renters Reform Bill
[
edit
]
The 
Renters Reform Bill
 would have impacted on both the 11 million private renters and 2.3 million landlords in England.
The bill was opposed by a number of MPs. Of the 47 MPs who signed amendments that weakened the protections provided by the bill, 14 of them were themselves landlords.
[
65
]
After the announcement of the 
2024 general election
, the bill was axed during the parliamentary 
wash-up period
.
[
66
]
The Renters Reform Bill would have:
[
67
]
Abolished section 21 ‘no fault’ evictions and move to a tenancy structure where all assured tenancies were periodic;
Introduced more comprehensive possession grounds so landlords could still recover their property (including where they wish to sell their property or move in close family) and to make it easier to repossess properties where tenants were at fault, for example in cases of anti-social behaviour and repeat rent arrears;
Provided stronger protections against eviction by ensuring tenants were able to appeal excessively above-market rents which were purely designed to force them out. Landlords would still be able to increase rents to market price for their properties and an independent tribunal would have made a judgement on this, if needed. To avoid fettering the freedom of the judiciary, the tribunal would continue to be able to determine the actual market rent of a property;
Introduced a new Private Rented Sector Ombudsman which would have provided fair, impartial, and binding resolution to many issues and prove quicker, cheaper, and less adversarial than the court system;
Created a Privately Rented Property Portal to help landlords understand their legal obligations and demonstrate compliance (giving good landlords confidence in their position), alongside providing better information to tenants to make informed decisions when entering into a tenancy agreement. It would have also supported local councils – helping them target enforcement activity where it was needed most;
Give tenants the right to request a pet in the property, which the landlord must consider and cannot unreasonably refuse. To support this, landlords would have been able to require pet insurance to cover any damage to their property.
Homelessness

Homelessness in the United Kingdom
In June 2015 there were approximately 67,000 households in England in temporary accommodation.

Housing quality

The consequence of the housing shortage manifests itself in overcrowding rather than In homelessness, The problem of over crowding is especially acute in London.
[
72
]
  In 2011 it was estimated that there were 391,000 children in London living in overcrowded conditions.
[
73
]
 Between 1995-1996 to 2013-2014 overcrowding, as measured by the bedroom standard increased from 63,000 households to 218,000 households.
[
74
]
 The bedroom standard understates overcrowding. It does not include potential household units forced to live in the same dwelling. For example, divorced couples living in the same dwelling, adult children being unable to form own household but having to live with their parents.
[
75
]
 A report issued in 2004 reviewed the evidence that overcrowding, in addition to the known impacts on physical health, adversely affects mental health and child development.

It is useful to consider housing quality under two sub-headings: physical and social. In the era of Beveridge Consensus there were large-scale slum clearance projects. Council environmental health officers inspected dwellings in a borough and those which failed to meet standards were compulsorily purchased  for a nominal sum and demolished.
[
77
]
New dwellings were built
 to rehouse the slum dwellers. Slum clearance significantly  improved the physical quality of the British housing stock. But in a seminal study 
Family and Kinship in East London
 it was found that although the physical quality of the housing had improved, its  social quality had deteriorated. The residents of apartments in tower blocks appreciated their clean, warm, bright new apartments, but missed the supportive community networks of the slums.
The overall quality of English housing stock has improved over the last thirty years, however, the quality of housing for new households varies.

The Building Better, Building Beautiful Commission was an independent body that advised the 
Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government
 on how to promote and increase the use of high-quality design for new build homes and neighbourhoods in the United Kingdom. The research was conducted on behalf of the Commission, and the findings have informed the recommendations in the report. It supports the creation of more beautiful, greener communities. The commission had 3 primary aims:
[
79
]
To promote better design and style of homes, villages, towns and high streets, to reflect what communities want, building on the knowledge and tradition of what they know works for their area.
To explore how new settlements can be developed with greater community consent.
To make the planning system work in support of better design and style, not against it.
Energy efficiency
[
edit
]
Main article: 
Energy efficiency in British housing
British Home Performance chart
There is a particular problem with dwellings built before 
World War I
 (1914-1918), which are now  over hundred years old.
[
80
]
 The terraced houses of this period, built for sale to the buy-to-let investors of the time, are particular difficult to insulate. These dwellings were built for heating by open coal fires, and had  large drafty windows to allow the fire to draw. They have very small rooms and have solid walls with a single leaf of bricks. This structure makes wall insulation expensive and in many cases impractical.
[
81
]
  Many of the dwellings of this type were replaced by council houses in the post war 
slum clearance program
, but with the ending of public sector building of dwellings this route for improving the energy efficient of the housing stock ended. 
There also insulation problems in the pre-1914 large houses built for the top decile of the time. These houses were built with servant quarters in the roof space. Most such houses have been converted into blocks of flats and sold to buy to let investors.
[
82
]
 These flats are difficult to insulate, especial the top floor flat in the roof space.
[
83
]
 The expense of insulation means that it is not often not cost effective for the landlord to insulate such dwellings. This is  especially true in London,  where due to the housing crisis, landlords can let a property in poor condition, and consequently improving the energy efficiency of a dwelling is not a priority for buy to let investors.
The Green Deal
 provided low interest loans for 
energy efficiency
 improvements to the energy bills of the properties the upgrades are performed on.
[
84
]
 These debts are passed onto new occupiers when they take over the payment of energy bills. The costs of the loan repayments should be less than the savings on the bills from the upgrades, however this will be a guideline and not legally enforceable guarantee. It is believed that tying repayment to energy bills will give investors a secure return. The Green Deal for the domestic property market was launched in October 2012. The Commercial Green Deal was launched in January 2012 and released in a series of stages to help with the varying needs and requirements of commercial properties.
Empty homes
[
edit
]
Number of dwellings in England that have been empty for more than six months (2003–2016)
[
85
]
According to official statistics, in October 2015, there were 600,179 vacant dwellings in England, a decline from the 610,123 from a year earlier. Of these vacant dwellings, 203,596 were vacant for more than six months.
[
86
]
 This, it is believed, is mainly due to financial reasons, such as the owner being unable to sell the house or raise enough money to renovate the property.
[
87
]
 In November 2017, the government allowed councils to charge a 100% council tax premium on empty homes.
[
88
]
According to official statistics, the percentage of empty homes in England fell from 3.5% in 2008 to 2.6% in 2014.
[
89
]
 One explanation for this housing transactions have picked up since the financial crisis, and because of government efforts to reduce the number of empty homes. An alternative explanation is that before April 2013 there was an incentive for property owners to report a property as empty, as there was a rebate on council tax for vacant property. And when this incentive was removed, property owners ceased informing the council that their property was empty, and this led to an apparent fall in empty homes reported by official statistics.
[
89
]
The number of empty homes includes homes where the previous occupier is in prison, in care, in hospital or recently deceased.
[
89
]
 The charity Empty Homes argued that empty homes were helping contribute to the housing crisis, saying in a report "The longer a property is empty the more our housing assets are being wasted. Also, the longer a property lies empty, the more likely it is to deteriorate; the more it is likely to cost to bring back into use; and the more it is likely to be seen as a blight by the neighbours."
[
89
]
Long-term empty homes
[
edit
]
In 2016, there were around 200,000 empty homes in the UK, down from 300,000 in 2010.
[
88
]
Empty Dwelling Management Orders
 (EMDOs) allow councils to take over the management of long-term empty properties but these are generally seen as a last resort and only 43 EDMOs were successful from 2006 to 2011. Government statistics show that long-term empty homes are generally concentrated post-industrial areas, in the North of England and in seaside towns, where property prices are generally lower, with the lowest percentage in London, which had 20,795 long-term empty properties, with the highest in Barrow-in Furness, Burley and Blackburn.
[
87
]
[
88
]
[
90
]
As of 2015, around 1.7% of homes in London are empty, which is a historically low level. The vacancy rate is much lower for London's private sector housing compared to the rest of the country, whereas the rates for affordable housing are "broadly similar".
[
91
]
 Research by 
Islington Council
 revealed  that nearly a third of new dwellings built did not have anyone on the electoral register after six years, although this may exclude students and foreign tenants.
[
92
]
The Observer
 reported on what has been termed 'lights out London' .. 'where absentee owners push up property prices without contributing to the local economy'.
[
93
]
 According to a local restaurateur 'my original customers [have sold to ] non-doms who do not live in their [property]. In some apartment blocks 20% were unoccupied... It makes a big difference [to my business]'.
[
94
]
Research by the 
London School of Economics
 for the 
Mayor of London
 found that there was almost no evidence of new build units being left empty, "certainly less than 1%" and that the "vast majority" of overseas buyers intended to live in the property or rent it out.

Housing cooperatives
[
edit
]
This section is an excerpt from 
Housing cooperative § United Kingdom
.
[
edit
]
Housing co-operatives are uncommon in the UK, making up about 0.1% of housing stock.
[
96
]
Most are based in urban areas and consist of affordable shared accommodation where the members look after the property themselves. Waiting lists can be very long due to the rarity of housing co-operatives. In some areas the application procedure is integrated into the 
council housing
 application system. The laws differ between England and Scotland. The Confederation of Co-operative Housing provides information on housing cooperatives in the United Kingdom and has published a guide on setting them up.

With more than 3,000 parks and open spaces, London is 
one of the world’s greenest cities
 – and that means this marvellous city has one for every occasion. And we really, really mean that. Whether you’re looking for a pristine picnic patch, a scruffy footie field, a serene sunbathing spot or an all-action sports park, London has it covered. 
Like a lot of people who have spent their twenties in this city, I’ve bounced between countless flat shares in various different neighbourhoods over my eleven years here, and it’s really made me realise two things; firstly, that wherever you are in London, you’re never that far from some gorgeous greenery.
And secondly, there are few greater pleasures to be had in this city than clocking off work and making a beeline for your favourite park on the first properly hot day of the summer, armed with a football, a novel, or just a couple of ice cold tinnies and some picky bits from the nearest offy.
Bliss, right? Here’s our lowdown on the major parks in London, so you can plan your next session in the sun.

outdoor London

Best London parks
1.
 Hampstead Heath
Things to do
Walks and tours
Hampstead Heath
© Paul
Wild and undulating, the 320-hectare grassy sprawl of Hampstead Heath makes a wonderfully untamed contrast to the more manicured parks elsewhere in the capital. A playground for picnickers, dog-walkers and nature-lovers alike, keep an eye out for some very special residents such as muntjac deer and parakeets.
Insider tip
 Take a dip in the heath’s swimming ponds. The men’s and ladies’ ponds are open all year round, but be warned that even in the summer the water is pretty frosty.

 Regent’s Park
Attractions
Parks and gardens
Regent’s Park
© Patrizia Ilaria Sechi
Covering 410 acres in north-west London, Regent’s Park is teeming with attractions, ranging from the animal noises of the ZSL London Zoo to its enchanting Open Air Theatre, food and music festivals that pitch up over the summer, and Frieze art fair, which takes place in October. But there’s good reason to come year-round, with beautiful rose gardens, a hidden Japanese garden, tennis courts, football pitches and eateries waiting to be enjoyed. Nearby Primrose Hill is considered part of the park and boasts great panoramic views.
Insider tip
 Come spring, I love hopping in an electric blue pedalo and gliding (or at least attempting to) across the boating lake. It gets you closer to some of the park’s many species of wildlife and feels even more peaceful than other areas you can explore by foot. Rowing boats are also available, and hire is cheaper before 1pm in the week or 12pm on weekends.

 Hyde Park
Attractions
Sightseeing
Hyde Park
As obvious choices go, this one has gotta be up there, but Hyde Park isn’t just a tourist destination. The largest of the four neighbouring Royal Parks in central London, Hyde Park was my go-to green space when I lived in nearby Bayswater. When friends visited from my hometown, I would always suggest we meet at Hyde Park Corner and Lime bike our way past the Serpentine and across the criss-cross paths which divide the grassiness into plots – it’s a fun (and quick) way to explore and take in a bit of the city skyline.
Insider tip:
 Enter the park via Victoria Gate and grab a coffee from the café in the Italian Gardens – its my favourite place to sit when the sun’s out.

 Holland Park

Parks and gardens
Holland Park
Andrew Brackenbury
One of London’s finest green spaces, the park surrounds a Jacobean mansion, Holland House, named after its second owner, the Earl of Holland, whose wife (fun fact!) was the first person in England to successfully grow dahlias. They’re still grown within its 55 acres, which also houses the Japanese-style Kyoto Gardens with its koi carp and picturesque bridge at the foot of a waterfall. In summer, open-air theatre and opera are staged in the park.
Insider tip
Keep your eyes peeled for the many peacocks, which are right at home amid the ornamental scenery.

Brockwell Park is a much-needed slab of green just south of Brixton. Locals from Herne Hill, Tulse Hill and Brixton flock here in summer to sun-worship, fly kites, swim in the famous lido, play football and parade all kinds of dogs.
Insider tip
Make a splash at Brockwell Lido and admire its grade II-listed art deco buildings, which have been at the centre of park life here since the 1930s.
6.
 Clapham Common
Attractions
Parks and gardens
Clapham

This oasis of peace amid the clogged traffic of south-west London dates back to the eighteenth century. At its perimeter, it has a number of cafés, a skate park and the largest bandstand in London, which hosts open-air concerts during the summer.
Insider tip
Grab your tackle and go fishing at Eagle Pond – the common’s most ‘natural’ lake – with wooden decked fishing platforms perfect for casting off. Just remember to pack your fishing permit.

7.
 Dulwich Park
Attractions
Parks and gardens
Dulwich
Situated right in the centre of swanky Dulwich Village, this park is charming and peaceful. Not only do the abundance of flowers mean that this park is easy on the eye, but it has a particularly friendly atmosphere. You’ll find all the usual suspects here, such as playgrounds, football pitches and tennis courts.
If you’re up for something sporty, then there is an outdoor gym complete with recumbent bikes (the chilled-out brother to the bikes in spin class). There’s also table tennis, and if you’re feeling particularly poetic, then you can hire a boat and float around the lake.
Insider tip
Take a look at Conrad Shawcross’s giant looping sculpture ‘Three Perpetual Chords’, which was commissioned to replace a Barbara Hepworth sculpture famously stolen from the park in 2011.
8.
 Battersea Park
Attractions
Zoos and aquariums
Battersea

Battersea Park has so much going for it that it’s almost unfair. What other green space in the capital can boast Thames views, an art gallery (The Pump House) and a family-run zoo, complete with lemurs, meerkats and wallabys? Oh, and there’s Battersea Dogs & Cats Home, too.
Insider tip
Check out the Buddhist London Peace Pagoda, which features four large gilded bronze sculptures of Buddhas overlooking the Thames.

 Greenwich Park
Attractions
Parks and gardens
Greenwich
© Alan Stanton
Greenwich Park boasts the honour of being the oldest enclosed Royal Park. A 183-acre grassland, it provides an urban sanctuary for deer, foxes and over 70 species of bird. Not only does it pack in a child-friendly boating lake, six tennis courts and the Greenwich Meridian Line, which represents the prime meridian, it’s also home to The Royal Observatory, while the views from the top of the hill across to Canary Wharf and beyond are spectacular, and well worth the trek.
Insider tip:
Take a look at Queen Elizabeth’s Oak. It may look like a mossy old lump of wood, but it’s been in the park since the twelfth century. Acording to legend, Henry VIII once danced around it with Anne Boleyn and Elizabeth I often had picnics on it.

 London Fields
Attractions
Parks and gardens
London Fields
Flickr / Nick Sarebi
This vibrant hipster hangout is probably the coolest of London’s green spots. It’s home to a permanent ping-pong table, a wildflower meadow in the spring and summer, and London Fields Lido, while Broadway Market is conveniently located nearby for posh picnic food.
Insider tip
 Bring a picnic, not a disposable barbecue. This used to be one of the few open spaces 
in London where you could barbecue legally, but that’s been changed recently due to cleaning costs. Remember, leave nothing but footprints, take nothing but pictures (or should that be selfies?).

 Peckham Rye Common
Attractions
Parks and gardens
Peckham
Photograph: Rosie Hewitson
If not exactly a ‘secret’, Peckham Rye is still hugely underrated in comparison to some of London’s more illustrious green spaces, even if former locals like myself will wax lyrical about the charms of its sprawling 
113 acres years after leaving the area. Perhaps that’s a good thing, because u
nlike some of London’s more famous parks, this place really belongs to its local community. On a sunny weeknight, you’ll find local sports teams practising everything from rugby to hurling, kids populating the well-maintained playground, groups of twenty-somethings lounging around on the grass listening to portable speakers, and countless hobbyist runners spluttering their way around its 2-mile circumference. 
Insider tip 
People tend to flock to the open fields on the corner of Rye Lane, but be sure to also explore the far side of the park, which is home to an outdoor gym, skate park, bowling green and several manicured gardens (the Japanese Garden, with its wisteria-covered pergola, is my personal fave).

St James’s Park was founded as a deer park for the royal occupants of St James’s Palace, and remodelled by architect John Nash on the orders of George IV. The central lake is home to numerous water-loving birds and its bridge offers some very snappable views of Buckingham Palace.
Insider tip
Keep an eye out for wandering pelicans, a species that has lived in the park since the seventeenth century. The big-billed birds are fed between 2.30pm and 3pm daily, though they have been known to supplement their diet at other times of the day with the occasional pigeon.

Victoria Park

Victoria Park started life as a Royal Park but became municipal to benefit the everyday people of the East End in 1887. It’s a bit rougher round the edges than its western counterparts, and has a great green expanse to kick back and let nature revitalise you. Wildlife includes a deer enclosure, moorhens, grey and canada geese, and squirrels, while, by the lake, you’ll find The Pavilion Café serving tasty, locally sourced food from breakfast to teatime. It also plays host to a theatrical fireworks display every November, plus summer festivals All Points East and Field Day. 
Insider tip
 If a deluge hits, take refuge in nearby People's Park Tavern, which has a vast covered terrace.

Parks and gardens
Richmond Park
Richmond Park is the largest of London’s Royal Parks, occupying 2,500 acres. There are hundreds of red and fallow deer roaming freely across it, presumably much happier without having to listen out for the ‘view halloo!’ cries of one of Henry VIII’s hunting parties. From the park’s highest point, there are famous views of St Paul’s Cathedral, more than 12 miles to the east.
Insider tip
Get your floral fix at the Isabella Plantation, a 40-acre woodland garden bursting with the bright blooms of azaleas, rhododendrons and camellias in the spring and summer.

Situated just north of Hampton Court Palace, Bushy Park is one of several vast open spaces that sprawl across the leafy borough of Richmond-upon-Thames. Named after the large number of hawthorn bushes that grow within its boundaries, it’s home to herds of both red and fallow deer.
Insider tip
Take a look at the Christopher Wren-designed Chestnut Avenue, where locals gather annually on Chestnut Sunday in May for a festival to celebrate the blooming of the trees.

Finsbury Park

Finsbury Park is underrated. Sure, everyone’s heard of it, and it’s on the Victoria line, but it rarely comes up when you think of London’s best and most iconic parks. But it has it all if you ask me. There’s a cute cafe, a boating lake and loads of sports stuff. I
t’s got a Yard Sale round the corner for al fresco dining, and it’s not as heaving as some of the other big boys so you can whack your portable speaker on while you picnic without anyone getting annoyed. Obviously, when it’s day festival season, stay as far away from Finsbury Park as physically possible. But it’s fabulous any other time of year.
Time Out tip 
Finsbury Park is the starting point for the Parkland Walk. It’’s one of London’s 
prettiest walks
, and takes you through the old railway all the way up to Highgate Village. End with a roast at the Wrestlers.

 Crystal Palace Park

Parks and gardens
Crystal Palace
The Crystal Palace, which gave the park its name, may have burnt to a crisp in 1936, but its landscaped grounds, which make up this delightful park in south-east London still house some pretty amazing features, including five massive dinosaur sculptures that lurk among the trees around a lake, the remains of a 
prehistoric Victorian theme park.
Insider tip
The park hides a beautiful, abandoned Victorian subway with a Grade II-listed vaulted walkway supported by intricate Italinate pillars, and patterned orange and white bricks. But before you go strolling over there, it’s only open three times a year – visit

The largest and most popular of leafy Stoke Newington’s multiple green spaces, Clissold Park’s 54 acres are blessed with just about all the facilities you could possibly want from your local park. Feeling sporty? There are tennis and table tennis courts, a skate part and a multi-use cage, as well as a bark-strewn running track that circles its perimiter. Entertaining kids? The playground features a zip wire, sand pit, metal slide and wooden shipwreck climbing frame, and there’s also an animal enclosure, butterfly dome, aviary and a splash pad offering a variety of water play features. Once you’ve worked up an appetite with all those activities, head to the Clissold House café for fairly-priced nibbles, or grab a coffee to go from Fink’s Pump House.
Insider tip
 When I visit, I make sure to check the noticeboard next to Clissold House for information on upcoming events. The park hosts all sorts, from a funfair in late spring, to live music, comedy, and a thrice-annual ‘feastival’ featuring dozens of street food and produce stalls, outdoor bars and free entertainment.

Piccadilly

This green, triangle-shaped expanse just beyond The Ritz to the south of Piccadilly was enclosed by Charles II as a hunting ground in 1668. Thankfully it was opened to the public in 1826 and today you’ll find lunching commuters and tourists lounging in the park’s famous stripy deckchairs. 
Insider tip
If you happen to be strolling through on the day of a special royal occasion look out for (although it’ll be pretty hard to miss) the Royal Gun Salute by the King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery. A basic salute involves 21 rounds of ear-shattering cannon fire, but in Green Park, 20 extra rounds are added – so hang on to your deckchair.

Alexandra Palace

For most Londoners, Alexandra Park is synonymous with Alexandra Palace or ‘Ally Pally’, the Grade II-listed music venue that sits atop the park’s hill and hosts the annual unruly World Darts Championship. But the surrounding parkland is vast – 196 acres, no less – and drop-dead beautiful no matter the season. I’ve spent many summer days steering a giant unicorn around the boating lake, crunching through carpets of yellow leaves on the tree-lined avenues in autumn, and sledding down the hill (when we get enough snow) in winter. And, of course, that panoramic city view is there to admire year-round.
Insider tip
 Ally Pally marks the start (or end) of the Parkland Walk, North London’s green belt that links Alexandra Park with Finsbury Park via an abandoned railway track. Pub pitstops, street art and gorgeous woodland can all be found on the way.

Kensington
At the end of the seventeenth century, William III – fed up with the dank air of Whitehall – relocated to Kensington Palace. Subsequently, a corner of Hyde Park (thereafter called Kensington Gardens) was sectioned off to make grounds for the residence. Princess Diana’s presence in Kensington Gardens is strong: the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Playground is a favourite for children and people flock all year round to her memorial fountain here.
Insider tip
Look out for the bronze statue of Peter Pan, erected in 1912; eight years earlier the playwright JM Barrie had met Jack Llewelyn Davies – the boy who was the inspiration for Peter – in the gardens.

Wimbledon Common

Famous among boomer Brits as the home of furry TV eco-heroes the Wombles, the 1,140-acre Wimbledon Common is one of the biggest green spaces in London. 
It takes about an hour to stroll from the Green Man on Putney Hill to Caesar’s Camp (actually an ancient hill fort) on the Wimbledon side – even longer if you decide to get lost in the woods, poke around the museum at Wimbledon Windmill, or stop for a pint at the Telegraph or the Fox and Grapes. Basically, it’s a taste of the well-to-do country life without stepping outside Greater London.
Insider tip
 The Capital Ring walk, which orbits inner London, cuts right across Wimbledon Common. Follow the signposts, duck under the A3 and you can stroll right into Richmond Park for another 2,000 acres of rural bliss.

Little Venice is a hidden gem nestled within Maida Vale, renowned for its picturesque canals and charming houseboats. This enchanting neighbourhood offers a unique and idyllic setting for tourists seeking a peaceful escape.

Additionally, the sense of community among the residents creates a friendly and secure environment. Tourists can take leisurely walks along the canals, enjoy boat rides, or simply unwind in one of the many waterside cafes, all while feeling safe and at ease.
4. Ealing
Ealing is a peaceful and family-friendly suburb located in West London. With its leafy streets, picturesque parks, and excellent transport links, this is an area that provides a tranquil retreat from the city centre whilst still maintaining easy accessibility to London’s attractions.

With dedicated police teams, community outreach programs, and active neighbourhood watch schemes, all contributing to its reputation as a safe area to stay in London, Ealing offers a welcoming atmosphere with low crime rates, making it 
11% safer 
than the worst part of London; Westminster.
5. Knightsbridge
Knightsbridge is a prestigious, high-end part of London that is renowned for luxury boutique 
shopping
, designer department stores, and exquisite residential properties. It is also in close proximity to popular tourist destinations such as the V&A museum and Hyde Park. 
This blend of opulence across both commercial and residential parts of the area sees a high level of security on offer through private security firms and the Metropolitan Police.

What is the safest type of accommodation to stay in London?
When it comes to choosing accommodation in London, safety should be a top priority for tourists. Different types of accommodation offer varying levels of security, and personal preferences also play a role. Here are some options to consider:
Hotels: 
Hotels are a popular choice for tourists due to their established safety measures. Reputable hotels often have security personnel, surveillance cameras, and secure access systems in place. They also offer the advantage of professional staff who can assist in case of emergencies or provide guidance on local safety concerns.
Serviced Apartments: 
Serviced apartments combine the convenience of a hotel with the comfort of a home. They generally offer a higher level of security compared to private rentals, as they often have reception desks, key card access, and on-site staff. They are also better for those looking for a 
longer stay.
Airbnb and Private Rentals:
 While 
Airbnb
 and private rentals can provide unique and cost-effective accommodation options, safety levels can vary. It’s crucial to research the property thoroughly, including reading reviews and assessing the neighbourhood’s safety. Look for listings that have positive reviews regarding safety and security and consider renting from experienced and highly rated hosts.
Hostels: 
Hostels are a popular choice for budget-conscious travellers, perhaps if you plan to stay for a month rather than a 
week
, and those seeking a social atmosphere. While hostels generally implement security measures such as lockers and surveillance cameras, it’s advisable to research individual hostels and their safety protocols beforehand.

Frequently Asked Questions
Is it Safe to Walk at Night in London?
Of course, safety is a main concern for tourists, particularly if it is an unfamiliar area. It is important to note, that on the whole, London is an incredibly safe city, however, we would recommend exercising caution in certain areas as well as at night time where crime rates tend to be a little higher. 
Stick to well-lit streets, avoid isolated areas, and use common sense precautions to ensure a safe experience.
Where Not to Stay in London as a Tourist?
Generally speaking, most areas of London are safe and suitable to stay in but, for peace of mind, we would recommend avoiding areas such as Canning Town, Tower Hamlets, and Hackney where crime rates are notably higher. 
More central areas of London have much higher crime rates so opting for an area a little out of the centre, such as Maida Vale or Greenwich, will ensure you have a safe base to return to after a long evening.
Summary
On the whole, London offers an entirely safe visit to those travelling to the city but there are, of course, better areas of the city to choose from as well as better accommodation types, such as serviced apartments and hotels. F
rom the tranquil green spaces of Regent’s Park to the opulent surroundings of Knightsbridge, there are little pockets right across the city that offer higher levels of security, ensuring you have a memorable stay for all the right reasons!

Understanding Safety in London
Yes, London is Safe!
While it is essential to be informed, it is equally important to remember that London is generally considered a safe city. Its crime rates are relatively low compared to other major urban centres, partly thanks to extensive CCTV coverage and a dedicated police force.
The most frequent crime you will likely encounter in London is personal theft, particularly phone theft. By taking simple precautions like being mindful of your phone in public places, avoiding displaying it openly, and leaving it sticking out of your back pocket where it is easily accessible, you can significantly reduce your risk of losing your phone.
Criteria for Choosing the Safest Neighbourhoods
London’s vast urban landscape, divided into distinct boroughs, presents a varied safety picture. While proximity to Central London and the City often correlates with higher crime rates, fuelled by the transient nature of tourists and workers, safety generally improves as you venture further out.
We have carefully analysed data from the 
London Datastore
, the official repository maintained by the Greater London Authority and the Mayor of London, to pinpoint the safest neighbourhoods. This comprehensive resource provides the most accurate and up-to-date crime statistics available.
Our assessment of safety extends beyond raw crime figures. We have taken into account a multi-faceted approach that considers:
Crime Statistics:
 Rates of various crimes, including violent offences, property crimes, and anti-social behaviour.
Police Response Times:
 The efficiency with which local authorities address incidents.
Community Engagement:
 The strength of community networks, neighbourhood watch initiatives, and resident involvement in safety efforts.
Local Amenities:
 Access to well-maintained parks, recreational facilities, and public spaces that foster a sense of well-being.
Resident Reviews:
 Feedback from individuals living in these areas offers valuable insights into their experiences and perceptions of safety.
By incorporating this comprehensive range of factors, we aim to provide a nuanced and holistic understanding of safety in each neighbourhood, enabling you to decide where to call home or visit in this dynamic city.
