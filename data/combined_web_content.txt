Overview of housing in the United Kingdom






Typical Victorian terraced housing in 
Hampshire
.


Housing in the United Kingdom
 represents the largest non-financial asset class in the UK; its overall net value passed the £5 trillion mark in 2014.
[
1
]
 Housing includes modern and traditional styles. About 30% of homes are owned outright by their occupants, and a further 40% are owner-occupied on a 
mortgage
.  About 18% are 
social housing
 of some kind, and the remaining 12% are privately rented.
[
2
]


The UK ranks in the top half in 
Europe
 with regard to rooms per person, amenities, and quality of housing.
[
3
]
[
4
]
 However, the cost of housing as a proportion of income is higher than average among EU countries,
[
3
]
 and the 
increasing cost of housing in the UK
 may constitute a housing crisis for some, especially in 
London
.

Housing is the jurisdiction of the 
Minister of State for Housing, Planning and Building Safety

History
[
edit
]


Pre Victorian era
[
edit
]


Medieval house using a timber structure


High-end Georgian stone terrace at Royal Crescent, Bath


In the medieval era and later, houses were often built of timber
[
9
]
 and were heated by fires. Houses were typically built individually until the advent of town planning in the Georgian era, when terraces began to be built.
[
10
]




Victorian era
[
edit
]


Rapid population growth took place in the nineteenth century, particularly terraces in cities with the widespread adoption of mass-produced bricks.
[
11
]
  The new homes were arranged and funded via building societies that dealt directly with large contracting firms.
[
12
]
[
13
]
   Private renting from housing landlords was the dominant tenure. People moved in so rapidly that there was not enough capital to build adequate housing for everyone, so low-income newcomers squeezed into increasingly overcrowded slums. Clean water, sanitation, and public health facilities were inadequate; the death rate was high, especially infant mortality, and 
tuberculosis
 among young adults.
[
14
]
[
15
]
[

]




1900–1939
[
edit
]


The rapid expansion of housing was a major success story of the interwar years, 1919–1939, standing in sharp contrast to the United States, where the construction of new housing practically collapsed after 1929. The total housing stock in England and Wales was 7,600,000 in 1911; 8,000,000 in 1921; 9,400,000 in 1931; and 11,300,000 in 1939.
[

The Wormholt Estate is typical of 'cottage' interwar housing - brick walls, tiled roofs, low rise with front and rear gardens.


Renting during 1900–1939
[

History of rent control in England and Wales § 1915 to 1939


The private rent market provided 90% of the housing before the war. Now it came under heavy pressure, regarding rent controls, and the inability of owners to evict tenants, except for non-payment of rent. The tenants had a friend in 
Liberal
 
Prime Minister
, 
David Lloyd George
, and especially in the increasingly powerful 
Labour Party
. The private rent sector went into a prolonged decline and never recovered; by 1938, it covered only 58% of the housing stock.
[
18
]


A decisive change in policy was marked by the 
Tudor Walters Report
 of 1918; it set the standards for council house design and location for the next ninety years.
[
19
]
[
20
]
 It recommended housing in short terraces, spaced at 70 feet (21 m) at a density of twelve to the acre.
[
21
]
   With the 
Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act 1919
 
David Lloyd George
 set up a system of government housing that followed his 1918 election campaign promises of "homes fit for heroes."  It required local authorities to survey their housing needs, and start building houses to replace slums. The treasury subsidised the low rents. The immediate impact was the prevalence of the three-bedroom house, with kitchen, bathroom, parlour, electric lighting, and gas cooking, often built as subsidised council housing. Major cities such as London and Birmingham built large-scale housing estates – one in Birmingham had a population of 30,000 residents. The houses were built in blocks of two or four using brick or stucco, with two storeys. They were set back from curving streets; each had a long garden. Shopping centres, churches and pubs sprang up nearby. Eventually, the city would provide a community hall, schools, and a public library. The residents typically were the upper fifth stratum of the 
working-class
. The largest of these two communities was 
Becontree
 in the outer suburbs of London, where construction began in 1921, and by 1932 there were 22,000 houses holding 103,000 residents.
[
22
]
 Slum clearance now moved from being a public health issue, to a matter of town planning.
[
23
]


Liberal MP 
Tudor Walters
 was inspired by the 
garden city movement
, calling for spacious low-density developments and semi-detached houses built to a high construction standard. Older women could now vote. Local politicians consulted with them and in response put more emphasis on such amenities as communal laundromats, extra bedrooms, indoor lavatories, running hot water, separate parlours to demonstrate their respectability, and practical vegetable gardens rather than manicured yards. The housewives had had their fill of chamber pots.
[
24
]
[
25
]
  Progress was not automatic, as shown by the troubles of rural 
Norfolk
. Many dreams were shattered as local authorities had to renege on promises they could not fulfill due to undue haste, impossible national deadlines, debilitating bureaucracy, lack of lumber, rising costs, and the unaffordability of rents by the rural poor.
[
26
]


In England and Wales, 214,000 multi-unit council buildings were built by 1939; making the Ministry of Health largely a ministry of housing.
[
27
]
 Council housing accounted for 10% of the housing stock in the UK by 1938, peaking at 32% in 1980, and dropping to 18% by 1996, where it held steady for the next two decades.

Statistics of home ownership and renting in England and Wales (1918-2011)


Debates on high-rise housing
[
edit
]


The fierce debates over high-rise housing that took place after 1945 were presaged by an acrimonious debate in the 1920s and 1930s in London. On the political left there was firm opposition to what were denounced as "barracks for the working-classes". Reformers on the right called for multi-storey solutions to overcrowding and high rents. There were attempts at compromise by developing new solutions to urban living, focused especially on slum clearance and redevelopment schemes. The compromises generally sought to replace inhospitable slums with high-rise blocks served by lifts. In the 
Metropolitan Borough of Stepney
 they included John Scurr House (built 1936–1937), Riverside Mansions (1925–1928) and the Limehouse Fields project (1925 but never built).
[
32

Ownership
[
edit
]


Increasingly the British ideal was home ownership, even among the working class. Rates of home ownership rose steadily from 15 percent of people owning their own home before 1914, to 32 percent by 1938, and 67 percent by 1996. The construction industry sold the idea of home ownership to upscale renters. The mortgage lost its old stigma of a millstone round your neck to instead be seen as a smart long-term investment in suburbanized Britain.  It appealed to aspirations of upward mobility and made possible the fastest rate of growth in working-class owner-occupation during the 20th century.
[
33
]
[
34
]
  The boom was largely financed by the savings ordinary Britons put into their building societies.  Starting in the 1920s favourable tax policies encouraged substantial investment in the societies, creating huge reserves for lending. Beginning in 1927, the societies encouraged borrowing through gradual liberalization of mortgage terms.
[

Post War
[
edit
]


Political poster: ″A million new homes thanks to Labour″


Political poster: ″The way things are going I shall grow up before we get our house. Vote Conservative for more houses more quickly.″


Housing was a critical shortage in the post-war era. Air raids had destroyed half a million housing units; repairs and maintenance on undamaged homes had been postponed. 3,000,000 new dwellings were needed. The government aimed for 300,000 to be built annually, compared to the maximum pre-war rate of 350,000. However, there were shortages of builders, materials, and funding. The 
Ministry of Works
 undertook the publication of a set of 
Post War Building Studies
, that established technical guidelines for the use of new or modernised building materials. Not counting 150,000 temporary prefabricated units, the nation was still 1,500,000 units short by 1951. Legislation kept rents down, but did not affect purchased houses. The ambitions of the  
New Towns Act 1946
 (
9 & 10 Geo. 6
. c. 68) project were idealistic, but did not provide enough urgently needed units. When the 
Conservative Party
 returned to power in 1951, they made housing a high priority and oversaw 2,500,000 new units, two-thirds of them through local councils. Haste made for dubious quality, and policy increasingly shifted toward renovation rather than new builds. Slums were cleared, opening the way for gentrification in the inner cities.
[
36
]


According to a 2018 study in the 
Economic History Review
, the ‘
stop-go
’ macroeconomic policy framework adopted by the Treasury and the Bank of England from the mid-1950s to the early 1980s restricted house-building during the period.
[

1980s onwards

Working-class families proved eager to purchase their council homes when the Thatcher ministry introduced the "
Right to Buy
" scheme in 1980, alongside restricting the construction of new 
council houses
.
[
38
]
 Consequently most housing was built by private developers of which the largest included 
George Wimpey
, 
Barratt Developments
 and 
Redrow plc
. 
Timber frames
 were used instead of masonry structures,
[
39
]
 although brick remained common as a facing material. For energy efficiency, PVC doors and windows replaced the use of wood and 
cavity wall insultation
 became compulsory.
[
40
]
 Developments typically provided for car parking which had historically taken place on street.

Gun Wharves, Wapping was converted from a warehouse to apartments.


At the same time 
urban renewal
 schemes resulted in the conversion of disused industrial buildings such as warehouses to apartments. Examples include 
Rotherhithe
 and 
Wapping
 alongside the Thames in London and the 
Albert Dock
 in Liverpool. There was also widespread construction of purpose-built apartment blocks including 
Wembley Park
 and 
Stratford
 in London, 
Salford Quays
 and 
Beetham Tower
 in Manchester.



Demography
[
edit
]


There are approximately 23 million dwellings in England and some 27 million across the UK. In 2009, about 30% of homes were owned outright by their occupants, and a further 40% were owner-occupied on a 
mortgage
. About 18% are 
social housing
 of some kind, and the remaining 12% are privately rented.
[
2
]
  The overall mean number of bedrooms is approximately 2.8.  Just under 40% of households have at least two spare bedrooms.
[
42
]
 20% of dwellings were built before 1919 and 15% were built post 1990.
[
42
]
 29% of all dwellings are 
terraced
, 42% are detached or semi-detached, and the remaining 29% are bungalows or flats. The mean floor area is 95 square metres.
[
42
]
 Approximately 4% of all dwellings were vacant.
[
42
]
 Approximately 385,000 households reported a fire between 2012 and 2014, the majority of which were caused by cooking.
[
43
]
 In 2014 2.6 million households moved dwelling, the majority of which (74%) were renters.

The 
Labour
 government suspected that there might be supply-side problems in the construction sector, and in 2006 commissioned the Callcutt Review of House Building Delivery,
[
45
]
 which was published in 2007. The Callcutt report noted the failure of the home building industry to increase the supply in response to price signals.
[
46
]
 There was a fall in the numbers of house completions after the 2008 recession, but by 2015 it was back up to 169,000.
[
47
]


According to the Centre for Ageing Better 21% of homes in the UK were built before 1919, 38% before 1946, and only 7% after 2000, making the  British housing stock older than any European Union countries.
[
48
]


Local planning authorities
 are required to continuously maintain sufficient land to meet housing needs for five years.
[

 It is estimated 250,000 new homes are needed each year just to keep up with the demand of the UK's continually growing population.

Purchase price of a dwelling
[

Main article: 
Affordability of housing in the United Kingdom


House in Hampstead Garden Suburb, 
London


After adjusting for inflation, the average cost of a home increased by a factor of 3.4 between 1950 and 2012.
[
51
]


In September 2015 the average house price was £286,000, and affordability of housing as measured by price to earnings ratio was 5.3.
[
52
]
 The UK's home dwelling cost per type in July 2018 was on average:
[
53
]




Detached: £378,473


Semi-detached: £230,284


Terraced: £200,889


Flat/maisonette: £230,603


London is ranked as the top city in the world in terms of the number of 
ultra high net worth individuals
 who are resident in a city.
[
54
]
 The consequence of this is seen in the high price for top-end dwellings. The most expensive home ever sold in the UK was 
2–8a Rutland Gate
, Hyde Park, which sold for £280 million in 2015.
[
55
]
 The most expensive street in the UK is 
Kensington Palace Gardens
, London, where the average price of a home is approximately £42 million.
[
56
]


A report for 
Wandsworth Borough Council
 found that overseas investors had a positive effect on housing affordability, both in bringing forward new homes in general and allowing the affordable housing part of schemes to be brought forward more quickly. They also found that there was very little evidence of housing being left empty.
[
57
]
 Dwellings represent the largest non-financial asset in the British balance sheet, with a net worth of £5.1 trillion (2014).
[

]
 In the national statistics rising house prices are regarded as adding to 
GDP
 and thus a cause of economic growth.



Renting
[
edit
]

History of rent control in England and Wales


Nearly two out of five households rent their home.
[
58
]
 However, the supply of rental properties has been declining since 2016 when the taxation treatment of rental property turned against landlords.
[
59
]
 Nearly all dwellings  are let using 
Assured shorthold tenancy
 agreements.
[
60
]
 For the initial period, typically six months or a year, neither side can terminate the agreement. After this period, landlords can terminate the agreement at two months' notice.

Council Tax
 is paid by the occupier of the home unless it is a 
house in multiple occupation
 (HMO) when the landlord is liable. In London, rents are double the national average, meaning that living in London has become a luxury good. People on median incomes who work in central London often live in the outer suburbs of London and the commuting towns of South East England.
[
61
]


In 2023, rental costs in England are found to be 25.4% more affordable than owning a property with a mortgage, marking the first time this has occurred since 2010. In Wales, renting is 15.8% more economical than owning a mortgaged property. However, in Scotland, owning a property with a mortgage is 5.5%
[
62
]
 more cost-effective than renting, and in Northern Ireland, it's 7.3% more advantageous to own a mortgaged property compared to renting.
[
63
]
[
64
]




Renters Reform Bill
[
edit
]


The 
Renters Reform Bill
 would have impacted on both the 11 million private renters and 2.3 million landlords in England.
The bill was opposed by a number of MPs. Of the 47 MPs who signed amendments that weakened the protections provided by the bill, 14 of them were themselves landlords.
[
65
]


After the announcement of the 
2024 general election
, the bill was axed during the parliamentary 
wash-up period
.
[
66
]


The Renters Reform Bill would have:
[
67
]




Abolished section 21 ‘no fault’ evictions and move to a tenancy structure where all assured tenancies were periodic;


Introduced more comprehensive possession grounds so landlords could still recover their property (including where they wish to sell their property or move in close family) and to make it easier to repossess properties where tenants were at fault, for example in cases of anti-social behaviour and repeat rent arrears;


Provided stronger protections against eviction by ensuring tenants were able to appeal excessively above-market rents which were purely designed to force them out. Landlords would still be able to increase rents to market price for their properties and an independent tribunal would have made a judgement on this, if needed. To avoid fettering the freedom of the judiciary, the tribunal would continue to be able to determine the actual market rent of a property;


Introduced a new Private Rented Sector Ombudsman which would have provided fair, impartial, and binding resolution to many issues and prove quicker, cheaper, and less adversarial than the court system;


Created a Privately Rented Property Portal to help landlords understand their legal obligations and demonstrate compliance (giving good landlords confidence in their position), alongside providing better information to tenants to make informed decisions when entering into a tenancy agreement. It would have also supported local councils – helping them target enforcement activity where it was needed most;


Give tenants the right to request a pet in the property, which the landlord must consider and cannot unreasonably refuse. To support this, landlords would have been able to require pet insurance to cover any damage to their property.


Homelessness
[
edit
]


Main article: 
Homelessness in the United Kingdom


In June 2015 there were approximately 67,000 households in England in temporary accommodation.
[
68
]
 In autumn 2014 there were around 2,400 rough sleepers in England, 27% of which were in London.
[
69
]
[
70
]
 In 2018, around 320,000 people were homeless in the United Kingdom, both adults and children.

Housing quality

]

 with regard to rooms per person, amenities, and quality of housing.

The consequence of the housing shortage manifests itself in overcrowding rather than In homelessness, The problem of over crowding is especially acute in London.
[
72
]
  In 2011 it was estimated that there were 391,000 children in London living in overcrowded conditions.
[
73
]
 Between 1995-1996 to 2013-2014 overcrowding, as measured by the bedroom standard increased from 63,000 households to 218,000 households.
[
74
]
 The bedroom standard understates overcrowding. It does not include potential household units forced to live in the same dwelling. For example, divorced couples living in the same dwelling, adult children being unable to form own household but having to live with their parents.
[
75
]
 A report issued in 2004 reviewed the evidence that overcrowding, in addition to the known impacts on physical health, adversely affects mental health and child development.

It is useful to consider housing quality under two sub-headings: physical and social. In the era of Beveridge Consensus there were large-scale slum clearance projects. Council environmental health officers inspected dwellings in a borough and those which failed to meet standards were compulsorily purchased  for a nominal sum and demolished.
[
77
]
 
New dwellings were built
 to rehouse the slum dwellers. Slum clearance significantly  improved the physical quality of the British housing stock. But in a seminal study 
Family and Kinship in East London
 it was found that although the physical quality of the housing had improved, its  social quality had deteriorated. The residents of apartments in tower blocks appreciated their clean, warm, bright new apartments, but missed the supportive community networks of the slums.

The overall quality of English housing stock has improved over the last thirty years, however, the quality of housing for new households varies.
[

The Building Better, Building Beautiful Commission was an independent body that advised the 
Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government
 on how to promote and increase the use of high-quality design for new build homes and neighbourhoods in the United Kingdom. The research was conducted on behalf of the Commission, and the findings have informed the recommendations in the report. It supports the creation of more beautiful, greener communities. The commission had 3 primary aims:
[
79
]




To promote better design and style of homes, villages, towns and high streets, to reflect what communities want, building on the knowledge and tradition of what they know works for their area.


To explore how new settlements can be developed with greater community consent.


To make the planning system work in support of better design and style, not against it.


Energy efficiency
[
edit
]


Main article: 
Energy efficiency in British housing
British Home Performance chart


There is a particular problem with dwellings built before 
World War I
 (1914-1918), which are now  over hundred years old.
[
80
]
 The terraced houses of this period, built for sale to the buy-to-let investors of the time, are particular difficult to insulate. These dwellings were built for heating by open coal fires, and had  large drafty windows to allow the fire to draw. They have very small rooms and have solid walls with a single leaf of bricks. This structure makes wall insulation expensive and in many cases impractical.
[
81
]
  Many of the dwellings of this type were replaced by council houses in the post war 
slum clearance program
, but with the ending of public sector building of dwellings this route for improving the energy efficient of the housing stock ended. 

There also insulation problems in the pre-1914 large houses built for the top decile of the time. These houses were built with servant quarters in the roof space. Most such houses have been converted into blocks of flats and sold to buy to let investors.
[
82
]
 These flats are difficult to insulate, especial the top floor flat in the roof space.
[
83
]
 The expense of insulation means that it is not often not cost effective for the landlord to insulate such dwellings. This is  especially true in London,  where due to the housing crisis, landlords can let a property in poor condition, and consequently improving the energy efficiency of a dwelling is not a priority for buy to let investors.

The Green Deal
 provided low interest loans for 
energy efficiency
 improvements to the energy bills of the properties the upgrades are performed on.
[
84
]
 These debts are passed onto new occupiers when they take over the payment of energy bills. The costs of the loan repayments should be less than the savings on the bills from the upgrades, however this will be a guideline and not legally enforceable guarantee. It is believed that tying repayment to energy bills will give investors a secure return. The Green Deal for the domestic property market was launched in October 2012. The Commercial Green Deal was launched in January 2012 and released in a series of stages to help with the varying needs and requirements of commercial properties.



Empty homes
[
edit
]


Number of dwellings in England that have been empty for more than six months (2003–2016)
[
85
]


According to official statistics, in October 2015, there were 600,179 vacant dwellings in England, a decline from the 610,123 from a year earlier. Of these vacant dwellings, 203,596 were vacant for more than six months.
[
86
]
 This, it is believed, is mainly due to financial reasons, such as the owner being unable to sell the house or raise enough money to renovate the property.
[
87
]
 In November 2017, the government allowed councils to charge a 100% council tax premium on empty homes.
[
88
]


According to official statistics, the percentage of empty homes in England fell from 3.5% in 2008 to 2.6% in 2014.
[
89
]
 One explanation for this housing transactions have picked up since the financial crisis, and because of government efforts to reduce the number of empty homes. An alternative explanation is that before April 2013 there was an incentive for property owners to report a property as empty, as there was a rebate on council tax for vacant property. And when this incentive was removed, property owners ceased informing the council that their property was empty, and this led to an apparent fall in empty homes reported by official statistics.
[
89
]


The number of empty homes includes homes where the previous occupier is in prison, in care, in hospital or recently deceased.
[
89
]
 The charity Empty Homes argued that empty homes were helping contribute to the housing crisis, saying in a report "The longer a property is empty the more our housing assets are being wasted. Also, the longer a property lies empty, the more likely it is to deteriorate; the more it is likely to cost to bring back into use; and the more it is likely to be seen as a blight by the neighbours."
[
89
]




Long-term empty homes
[
edit
]


In 2016, there were around 200,000 empty homes in the UK, down from 300,000 in 2010.
[
88
]
 
Empty Dwelling Management Orders
 (EMDOs) allow councils to take over the management of long-term empty properties but these are generally seen as a last resort and only 43 EDMOs were successful from 2006 to 2011. Government statistics show that long-term empty homes are generally concentrated post-industrial areas, in the North of England and in seaside towns, where property prices are generally lower, with the lowest percentage in London, which had 20,795 long-term empty properties, with the highest in Barrow-in Furness, Burley and Blackburn.
[
87
]
[
88
]
[
90
]


As of 2015, around 1.7% of homes in London are empty, which is a historically low level. The vacancy rate is much lower for London's private sector housing compared to the rest of the country, whereas the rates for affordable housing are "broadly similar".
[
91
]
 Research by 
Islington Council
 revealed  that nearly a third of new dwellings built did not have anyone on the electoral register after six years, although this may exclude students and foreign tenants.
[
92
]
 
The Observer
 reported on what has been termed 'lights out London' .. 'where absentee owners push up property prices without contributing to the local economy'.
[
93
]
 According to a local restaurateur 'my original customers [have sold to ] non-doms who do not live in their [property]. In some apartment blocks 20% were unoccupied... It makes a big difference [to my business]'.
[
94
]


Research by the 
London School of Economics
 for the 
Mayor of London
 found that there was almost no evidence of new build units being left empty, "certainly less than 1%" and that the "vast majority" of overseas buyers intended to live in the property or rent it out.

Housing cooperative § United Kingdom
.
[
edit
]


Housing co-operatives are uncommon in the UK, making up about 0.1% of housing stock.
[
96
]


Most are based in urban areas and consist of affordable shared accommodation where the members look after the property themselves. Waiting lists can be very long due to the rarity of housing co-operatives. In some areas the application procedure is integrated into the 
council housing
 application system. The laws differ between England and Scotland. The Confederation of Co-operative Housing provides information on housing cooperatives in the United Kingdom and has published a guide on setting them up.
[
97
]
 The 
Shelter
 website provides information on housing and has information specific to 
England
 and 
Scotland
.


The Catalyst Collective provides information about starting co-operatives in the UK and explains the legal structure of a housing coop.
[

Radical Routes
 offers a guide on how to set up a housing co-operative.

The average price of a residential property in the UK as of 2019


The 
affordability of housing in the UK
 reflects the ability to rent or buy property. There are various ways to determine or estimate housing affordability. One commonly used metric is the median housing affordability ratio; this compares the median price paid for residential property to the median gross annual earnings for full-time workers. According to official government statistics, housing affordability worsened between 2020 and 2021, and since 1997 housing affordability has worsened overall, especially in London. The most affordable local authorities in 2021 were in the North West, Wales, Yorkshire and The Humber, West Midlands and North East.

Housing tenure in the 
UK
 has the following main types: Owner-occupied, private rented sector (PRS), and social rented sector (SRS).
[
2
]
 The affordability of 
housing in the UK
 varies widely on a regional basis – house prices and rents will differ as a result of market factors such as the state of the local economy, transport links, and the supply of housing.





Key determinants of affordability
[
edit
]


For owner-occupied properties, key determinants of affordability are house prices, income, 
interest rates
, and purchase costs. For rented property, PRS rents will largely be a reflection of house prices, while SRS rents are set by 
Local Authorities
, 
Housing Associations
 or similar.

House prices
[
edit
]


Land Registry figures for England and Wales show that housing prices rose from £70,000 to £224,000 in the 20 years between 1998 and 2018.
[

]
 Growth was almost continuous during the period, save for two years of decline around 2008 as a result of the 
banking crisis
.

United Kingdom housing affordability as described by mortgage payments as a percentage of take-home pay from 1983 to 2015


United Kingdom housing affordability as described by house price to earnings ratio from 1984 to 2015


The gap between average income and average housing prices changed between 1985 and 2015 from twice an average salary to up to six times average income. 
Median
 house prices in London the 
median
 house now cost up to 12 times the median London salary. In 1995, the median house price was £83,000, 4.4 times the median income. By 2012–13, the median income in London had increased to £24,600 and the median London house price had increased to £300,000, 12.2 times median income

In 1995, the Bank 
base rate
 was 6%, in March 2009 it stood at 0.5% until August 2016 when it was further reduced to 0.25%.

Effect of planning restrictions on house prices
[
edit
]


A semi-detached house for sale in London zone 5 (Croydon) in 2007


An analysis by the 
LSE
 and the Dutch 
Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis
 found that house prices in England would have been 35% cheaper without regulatory constraints.
[
10
]
 A report by the 
Adam Smith Institute
 found that by using 4% of London's 
green belt
, one million homes could be built within a 10-minute walk of a railway station.
[
11
]


The Economist
 has criticised green belt policy, saying that unless more houses are built through reforming planning laws and releasing green belt land, then housing space will need to be rationed out.  It noted that if general inflation had risen as fast as housing prices had since 1971, a chicken would cost £51; and that Britain is "building less homes today than at any point since the 1920s".
[
12
]
  According to the independent 
Institute of Economic Affairs
, there is "overwhelming empirical evidence that planning restrictions have a substantial impact on housing costs" and are the main reason why housing was two and a half times more expensive in 2011 than it was in 1975.
[
13
]


The 
Campaign to Protect Rural England
 argued that "Green Belt land is important for our wider environment, providing us with the trees and the undeveloped land which reduce the effect of the heat generated by big cities. Instead of reducing this green space, we should be using it to its best effect. We know from our research that three-quarters (79%) of the population would like to see more trees planted and more food grown in the areas around towns and cities."

Valuation of land and effect on house prices
[
edit
]


Value of land and buildings in the UK from 1995 to 2016 (trillions)
[
15
]


Property companies state that land values follow house prices and that a developer assesses what new build house price is achievable in any particular location with reference to prices and sales rates in the second-hand market and on nearby comparable new build sites. At a basic level (assuming no 
affordable housing
, 
S106
 or CIL), they then multiply that new build house price by the number of homes to be built on the land and to arrive at the gross development value (GDV) of the site. The underlying value of the land is then the GDV less the cost of development and less an allowance for profit.
[
16
]


According to a study by Knoll, Schularick and Steger, up to 80% of the rise in houses prices between 1950 and 2012 can be attributed to the increasing price of land.
[
17
]
[
18
]
 This is for two reasons. Firstly, before 1950 improving transport meant that more and more land was economically usable, but this effect subsided after 1950. Secondly, zoning restrictions did not allow the "utilisation of additional land".
[
17
]


In 2015, the Department for Communities and Local Government shared the land value estimates for residential land, agricultural land and industrial land. It found that the average price of a typical agricultural plot was £21,000.
[
19
]




Property costs
[
edit
]


The principal taxes imposed by the central government are Stamp Duty and Value Added Tax (VAT). Other costs which are associated with the buying and selling of property are 
estate agent
 fees, 
conveyancing
 and survey fees, 
mortgage arrangement fees
 (where applicable), and removal costs.
[
20
]




Stamp duty land tax
[
edit
]


Main article: 
Stamp duty land tax


Stamp duty land tax
 (SDLT) is payable on property transactions in England and Northern Ireland. Tax is paid at different rates on different portions of the purchase price. For example, on a £600,000 house, no tax is paid on the first £250,000, and the portion (£350,000) in the £250,000-£925,000 tax band is charged at 5%, i.e. £17,500. This gives a total tax of £17,500.







Purchase price of property


Rate of SDLT on portion of purchase price





£40,000 - £250,000


0%





£250,001 to £925,000


5%





£925,001 to £1,500,000


10%





Over £1,500,000


12%



Scotland and Wales apply their own tax to property transactions, replacing SDLT. Scotland introduced the 
Land and Buildings Transaction Tax
 in 2015, and Wales introduced the 
Land Transaction Tax
 in 2018.



Estate agent fees
[
edit
]


In 2011, 
Which?
 magazine found the national average estate agents' fees to be 1.8%.
[
21
]
 But fees can range between 0.75% to 3% depending on where you are in the UK.
[
22
]




Survey
[
edit
]


There are four main types of survey: a valuation survey, a condition report, a homebuyer report and a full 
structural survey
.
[
23
]




Legal fees
[
edit
]


Conveyancing fees vary according to the value of the property and the service provided.
[
24
]




Mortgage arrangement fees
[
edit
]


In April 2013, 
The Daily Telegraph
 reported that research by 
Moneyfacts
 showed the average mortgage arrangement fee to be £1522.
[
25
]




Housing shortage
[
edit
]


In 2020, the BBC reported the UK's 
housing gap
 was in excess of one million homes,
[
26
]
 and previously (in 2019) that "An estimated 8.4 million people in England are living in an unaffordable, insecure or unsuitable home, according to the National Housing Federation".
[
27
]
 Unaffordable housing is defined by the Affordable Housing Commission as to where housing costs are above 30% of household income.
[
28
]
 In a government briefing paper, 'Tackling the under-supply of housing in England',
[
29
]
 Barton and Wilson describe England's housing need as being illustrated by issues "such as increased levels of overcrowding, acute affordability issues, more young people living with their parents for longer periods, impaired labour mobility resulting in businesses finding it difficult to recruit and retain staff, and increased levels of homelessness".
[
29
]


Despite an added 244,000 homes to England's housing stock in 2019/20, the notion that an increased supply of housing will improve affordability has been challenged: the 
UK Housing Review (September 2017
) states, "Indeed as the evidence to the Redfern Review from Oxford Economics reminds us, it is unlikely to bring house prices down except in the very long term and with sustained high output of new homes relative to household growth. Even boosting (UK) housing supply to 310,000 homes per annum in their model only brings a five per cent fall in the baseline forecast of house prices".
[
30
]
 Therefore, the National Housing Federation (NHF) and Crisis from Heriot-Watt University argue that alongside the needed 340,000 new homes each year (until 2031), 145,000 of those “must be affordable homes”.
[
29
]
[
31
]




Other factors affecting affordability
[
edit
]


Council tax
[
edit
]


The 
Joseph Rowntree Foundation
 has suggested replacing the current 
Council tax
 system based on bands of house prices with a system that would mean the tax was more closely related to property prices. This would increase taxes on the highest-priced properties and decrease them for the lowest. They claim it would also have the effect of reducing house price 
volatility
.
[
32
]


Land value tax
 is suggested by some as a replacement for council tax; it would be based entirely on land (i.e. location) value and not on the value of buildings built on a piece of land or improvements made.
[
33
]
[
34
]
[
35
]




International investment demand
[
edit
]


In 2015, the 
Bow Group
, a conservative think-tank, produced a report suggesting a reduction in international investment demand of property. The report proposed limiting foreign residents to the purchase of single new-build properties, with penalties if sold within five years.
[
36
]
 In 2016, London mayor Sadiq Khan launched an inquiry into housing costs in the city, also highlighting the effect of foreign investment.
[
37
]




Second home ownership
[
edit
]


The government set up a £60 million fund to help councils deal with high levels of second home ownership.
[
38
]
 In 2016, a referendum in 
St Ives
, 
Cornwall
 found 83.2% of voters in favour of new housing projects being reserved for full-time residents, as many tourists frequent the area and Cornwall is popular for 
second home
 and holiday property ownership.
[
39
]




Buy-to-let tax changes
[
edit
]


From April 2016, a stamp duty surcharge of three per cent of the purchase price was required for those 
buying to let
. From April 2017, buy-to-let mortgage interest payments will have higher rates of income tax relief phased out by the government.
[
40
]
 Although, companies would not be affected by the new rules.
[
41
]




Rented homes
[
edit
]


The English Housing Survey Bulletin 13
[
42
]
 states that in 2013/14 there were 4.4 million households in the private rented sector and 3.9 million households in the social rented sector, of whom 2.3 million households (10%) were renting from a housing association and 1.6 million (7%) were renting from a local authority. Private renters had the highest weekly housing costs, paying on average £176 per week in rent. Mortgagors paid an average of £153 per week in mortgage payments while mean weekly rents in the social housing sector were £98 for housing association tenants and £89 for local authority tenants. When considering the gross weekly income, including benefits, of all household members, the proportion of income spent on housing costs was 18% for mortgagors, 29% for social renters, and 34% for private renters.

London
[
edit
]


The demand for more affordable housing has often been higher in London than in the rest of the UK.
[
43
]
 Research from 
Trust for London
 found that 24% of new housing completions in the three years to 2015/16 were affordable, which represented 21,500 homes. 6,700 affordable homes were completed in 2015/16, which is just 39% of the target set in the 2015 London Plan.
[
44
]
 They also found that the amount of affordable homes being built varies significantly between the London Boroughs. Tower Hamlets delivered 1830 affordable homes in the three years to 2015/16, the most in London, while Bexley only delivered 7, the fewest in London.
[
45
]
 Affordable housing is defined as housing that costs no more than 80% of the average local market rent.

Ground-rents are a still more proper subject of taxation than the rent of houses. A tax upon ground-rents would not raise the rents of houses.
